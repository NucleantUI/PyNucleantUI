/// A CPU-fed render node: the content is a pixel buffer some CPU-side
/// producer (e.g. the NES PPU) writes each frame, uploaded into the
/// node's VkImage through a persistently-mapped staging buffer — plus
/// the same compute post-shader slot `ThorShaderNode` carries, so a
/// `CanvasShader` (CRT filter, bloom, …) runs on the uploaded pixels
/// before the composite pass samples them.
///
/// `@Observable` for the same reason as the other nodes: the owning
/// `RenderNode` slot tracks `dirty` / the compute trio, so a `write`
/// or a pipeline swap re-renders on its own.
///
/// Threading contract: `write` and the engine's frame loop must share a
/// thread (everything runs on main today). `write` only touches the
/// CPU-side backing store — the copy into the staging slice happens at
/// record time, after the frame fence proved the GPU is done with that
/// slice, so the producer can never scribble over pixels the GPU is
/// still reading.
