/// `@Observable` for the same reason as `ThorShaderNode`: the owning
/// `RenderNode` slot tracks `dirty` / the compute trio. The node itself
/// watches its registered inputs and funnels their changes into `dirty`
/// (+ `descriptorsNeedRebind`), so a pipeline swap, a new input, or an
/// input's rebuilt handles all re-render on their own.
